Hi! I'm Oudom and this is an introduction to my blog!

## Why am I starting to blog?

The idea of blogging came to me back when I was doing a security course back at University, it was COMP6841 with Richard Buckland. Every week I had to blog about security topics and what I've learned from it and so forth. At that time, it seemed very tedious, after all, one of the reasons why I am in STEM is so that I don't have to write as much. In retrospect, blogging was a great way to engage with the course content.

Another reason as to why I wanted to start blogging was so that I could in a way track my growth and progress, especially when it comes to my mindset. I could create a digital image of myself and see how far I've grown since then(also helps that I am a nostalgic person).

## What can you expect from the blog?

I am a curious person by nature and I love to learn! so expect content from various fields.
In terms of writing style, my goal is to explain topics in simpler terms such that a high-schooler or a first year university student could understand.
